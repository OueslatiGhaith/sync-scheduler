- [ ] Job Prioritization:
      Add a priority system for jobs, ensuring that high-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority ones when resources are limited.
- [ ] Dynamic Thread Pool:
      Instead of a fixed thread pool size, implement a dynamic thread pool that can grow or shrink based on the current workload.
- [ ] Job Cancellation and Pausing:
      Add functionality to cancel or pause running jobs, and to resume paused jobs.
- [ ] Improved Error Handling and Retries:
      Implement a more sophisticated error handling system, including automatic retries for failed jobs with configurable retry policies.
- [ ] Job Metrics and Monitoring:
      Implement detailed metrics collection for jobs (e.g., execution time, success rate) and expose these metrics for monitoring systems.
- [ ] Event-driven Jobs:
      Implement a system where jobs can be triggered by external events, not just time-based schedules.
- [ ] Dynamic Job Creation:
      Allow for programmatic creation of new jobs at runtime, without needing to restart the scheduler.
- [ ] Job Forking:
      Allow jobs to spawn child jobs dynamically during execution, useful for tasks that discover work to be done as they run.
- [ ] Job Chaining:
      Implement a way to chain jobs together, where the output of one job becomes the input for the next.
- [ ] Customizable Job Lifecycle Hooks:
      Extend the current hook system to allow for more granular control over the job lifecycle.
- [ ] Conditional Execution:
      Implement a system where jobs can have conditions attached, and only run if those conditions are met.
- [ ] Time Window Constraints:
      Add the ability to specify time windows when jobs are allowed to run, useful for maintenance windows or respecting quiet hours.
